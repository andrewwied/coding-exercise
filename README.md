# About
This is a little exercise we can work through together to get an idea how you code. Don't worry - we're in this together, so feel free to ask for opinions or questions, look things up, or any other regular development activities. 

Don't worry about getting it all done before you run it for the first time, we know that's not how it is in the real world and we're not trying to spring any "gotchas" on you. We just want to know your train of thought and how it will be when you're working on our team!

# Problem

We want to build a function which, given a positive integer, returns a newline-delimited series of cyclic permutations of the numbers from 1 to the supplied number. It's probably easier to know what this means by looking at some examples:

## Examples
Input: `0`
Output: 
```
<empty string>
```

Input: `1`
Output: 
 ```
  1
 ```

 Input: `2`
 Output:
 ```
 12
 21
 ```

 Input: `3`
 Output:
 ```
 123
 312
 231
 ```

 Input: `4`
 Output: 
 ```
 1234
 4123
 3412
 2341
 ```

.. and so on. Don't worry about negative numbers.

# Technical 
You can output the answer to the console, or you can use the included unit tests. You can run `Program.cs` to output the values to the console, and the unit test is in the `Tests` folder. Anything else, please feel free to ask.
